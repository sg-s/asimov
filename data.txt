One of those things is that the new edge-to-edge iPhone is codenamed D22, and that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/892042013297790977\">the OS explicitly supports an iPhone display with hardware resolution of 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125 pixels</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For reference, all 4.7-inch iPhones to date (6, 6S, and 7) have a display resolution of 1334\u2009\u00d7\u2009750, at 326 PPI. All Plus models to date have a display resolution of 1920&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1080, at 401 PPI. Apple publishes these numbers on the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/\">iPhone tech specs comparison page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Back in 2014, in the lead-up prior to the announcement of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2014/08/larger_iphone_display_conjecture\">I tried to guess the pixel dimensions of both phones</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But after giving it much thought, and a lot of tinkering in a\nspreadsheet, here is what I think Apple is going to do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4.7-inch display: 1334 \u00d7 750, 326 PPI @2x</li>\n<li>5.5-inch display: 2208 \u00d7 1242, 461 PPI @3x</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>@2x means the same \u201cdouble\u201d retina resolution that we\u2019ve seen on\nall iOS devices with retina displays to date, where each virtual\n<em>point</em> in the user interface is represented by two physical\npixels on the display in each dimension, horizontal and vertical.\n@3x means a new \u201ctriple\u201d retina resolution, where each user\ninterface point is represented by three display pixels. A single\n@2x point is a 2 \u00d7 2 square of 4 pixels; an @3x point is a 3 \u00d7 3\nsquare of 9 pixels.</p>\n\n<p>I could be wrong on either or both of these conjectured new\niPhones. I derived these figures on my own, and I\u2019ll explain my\nthought process below. No one who is truly \u201cfamiliar with the\nsituation\u201d has told me a damn thing about either device. I have\nheard second- and third-hand stories, though, that lead me to\nthink I\u2019m right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My guess about the 4.7-inch display was exactly correct. My guess about the 5.5-inch display was wrong, but my logic was right. All 5.5-inch iPhone Plus models have hardware 1920&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1080 displays at 401 PPI, but at their default scaling (&#8220;Standard&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;Zoomed&#8221; in the Display section of Settings) they <em>pretend</em> to be 2208 \u00d7 1242 displays at 461 PPI, exactly as I predicted. (Actually, it&#8217;s better to think of it as 462 pixels per inch, because 462 is evenly divisible by 3, which is what you need to do convert pixels into points on an @3x retina display. So let&#8217;s use 462 henceforth. I should have thought of this back in 2014.)</p>\n\n<p>iOS scales the user interface on the Plus models from the virtual resolution of 2208 \u00d7 1242 to the actual hardware resolution of 1920&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1080 on the fly. The upside of this is that the display is less expensive and consumes less power. The downside is that the UI is not rendered pixel perfectly &#8212; the scaling uses anti-aliasing to fake it. But because the pixels are so very small, almost no one has sharp enough eyes to notice it, and because the physical resolution is so high (401 PPI), it looks sharper than the 4.7-inch displays which are running at their &#8220;true&#8221; resolution, with no scaling. But pixel-perfect &#8220;true&#8221; @3x would look even better.</p>\n\n<p>Using similar logic, and considering all of the rumors and purported part leaks, I have a highly-educated guess as to the dimensions of the D22 display:</p>\n\n<p>5.8 inches, 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125, 462 PPI, true @3x retina with no scaling.</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen the numbers 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125 before. Supply-chain rumor savant Ming-Chi Kuo suggested those numbers in a report back in February, which was summarized by both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/15/2017-iphone-edge-to-edge-display-virtual-buttons/\">MacRumors</a> and <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/16/iphone-8-higher-pixel-density/\">9to5Mac</a>. But what Kuo has predicted is different from what I&#8217;m suggesting. Kuo said the OLED display in this year&#8217;s new OLED iPhone will measure 5.8 inches diagonally and will have a total hardware resolution of 2800&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1242. That&#8217;s corner to corner, the entire front face of the device, minus the bezels on the sides, top, and bottom. Within this 5.8-inch display, Kuo said there would be a 5.15-inch &#8220;display area&#8221; with resolution 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125. The remaining area at the bottom of the display would be a &#8220;function area&#8221; (his term) where, presumably, a virtual home button would appear.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2017/08/kuo-d22.jpg\">Here is the actual image from Kuo&#8217;s report</a>, illustrating this.</p>\n\n<p>I think Kuo has it wrong, and is conflating the pixel dimensions of two different iPhones. I think this year&#8217;s new flagship iPhone, D22, has a 5.8-inch 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125 display. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Kuo heard about a 2800&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1242 display, too, but if so I think that phone is a Plus-sized version of this new form factor, with the same 462 PPI density and a size of around 6.6 inches diagonally. Such a display, with the reduced bezel design of D22, would be exactly as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus and slightly narrower. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/23/iphone-9-rumored-display-sizes/\">if such a phone is in the pipeline for 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From what I&#8217;ve seen, Kuo specified the size (5.8 inches) and the pixels (2800&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1242), but he didn&#8217;t specify the PPI density. But given the size and the horizontal and vertical pixel counts, you can work out the PPI. <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/16/iphone-8-higher-pixel-density/\">Benjamin Mayo did so</a>, and the result is 521 PPI.</p>\n\n<p><em>A 521 PPI display doesn&#8217;t actually make sense though.</em> I didn&#8217;t really think about this until today, but that number should have stuck out like a sore thumb back in February. Here&#8217;s the thing. It matters how big a <em>point</em> is, because it directly affects the real-world size of on-screen elements.</p>\n\n<p>All non-Plus iPhones to date &#8212; every one of them from the original iPhone in 2007 through the iPhone 7 &#8212; has a display with 163 <em>points</em> per inch. In the pre-retina era, that meant 163 <em>pixels</em> per inch, too. Each pixel was a point, each point was a pixel. All @2x iPhone retina displays have 326 pixels per inch. Divide by 2 and you get 163 <em>points</em> per inch. That means that a 44-point touch target is exactly the same physical size on screen on all non-Plus iPhones. 16-point type renders at exactly the same size, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The 6/6S/7 Plus phones have a slightly lower <em>points</em> per inch density: take 462 (the number of pixels per inch in the <em>scaled</em> version of the UI), divide by 3 (because it&#8217;s an @3x retina display) and you get 154 points per inch. That&#8217;s OK, though, because fewer points per inch means that a, say, 44-<em>point</em> touch target will be slightly bigger on screen. 16-point type will render slightly larger, and so on. Larger tap targets are easier to hit, and larger type is easier to read. The iPhones Plus use most of their extra pixels (compared to their non-Plus siblings) to show more content on screen. But they also use them to make all content slightly larger.</p>\n\n<p>A 521-PPI display doesn&#8217;t make sense because if you divide by 3 (because it&#8217;s @3x retina), you get around 174 <em>points</em> per inch. That&#8217;s not a huge difference, but everything would appear smaller on screen compared to an iPhone 7, and quite a bit smaller than on an iPhone 7 Plus. The only two natural pixel-per-inch densities for an @3x iPhone display are 462 PPI (154&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3) and 489 PPI (163&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3).</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>What about scaling?</em>&#8221; you might be thinking. Couldn&#8217;t the resolution of the display be 521 PPI and Apple could make the points per inch work out by scaling the interface dynamically, like they do on the Plus models? They <em>could</em>, but that would be really dumb. For one thing, if it&#8217;s @3x, they&#8217;d have to scale the UI <em>up</em>, not <em>down</em>. They&#8217;d be using a smaller image to fill a bigger screen. With the Plus, they use a larger image to fill a smaller screen. Scaling down is a reasonable and interesting compromise. Scaling up would be stupid. Surely a 521-PPI display would cost more to manufacture than a 462-PPI display. So why would Apple pay more for a display and use scaling when they could pay less for a 462 PPI display on which they don&#8217;t have to do any scaling at all? It would cost less, look better, and be more efficient.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>So we know that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/892042013297790977\">iOS 11 has support for a 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125 iPhone display</a>. We know that 462 PPI is the &#8220;natural&#8221; (no scaling) resolution for @3x retina on iPhone. We know that a 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125 display with 462 PPI density would measure 5.8 inches diagonally. We know that all rumors to date about the D22 iPhone claim it has a 5.8-inch display. We know that a 5.8-inch display with a 2.17:1 aspect ratio (2436/1125), combined with 4-5mm bezels on all sides, would result in a phone whose footprint would be just slightly taller and wider than an iPhone 7. And we know that all rumors to date say that D22 is slightly bigger than an iPhone 7.</p>\n\n<p>We also know that the same section of iOS 11 that specifies the 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125 display does <em>not</em> mention anything about a 2800&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1242 display. Further, that same section of iOS refers to the iPhone Plus as having a 1920&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1080 display &#8212; this is part of the OS that deals with the actual hardware resolution of the displays, not the virtual scaled display size.</p>\n\n<p>We also know that a 2800&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1242 display would have a slightly different aspect ratio: 2.25:1. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/893625588891701249\">Stephen Troughton-Smith noted today with a mockup</a> that a purported schematic of D22 made from precise blueprints, which was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1/status/856073055701020673\">leaked on Twitter by Benjamin Geskin</a> back in April of this year, shows a display that <em>exactly</em> matches the 2.17:1 aspect ratio of a 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125 display. A 2800&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1242 display <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2017/08/2800.png\">doesn&#8217;t come close to fitting</a> that schematic.</p>\n\n<p>We <em>know</em> these things. All of these facts point to the same conclusion: D22&#8217;s display is 5.8 inches, 2436&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1125, 462 PPI. The only reason to think otherwise is that Ming-Chi Kuo reported otherwise back in February. The simplest explanation is that Kuo got this <a href=\"https://www.ped30.com/2016/04/24/apple-ming-chi-kuo-truthiness/\">wrong</a>, and either he or his sources conflated the displays of two different iPhones.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-08-05\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-08-05\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-08-05\">\n<p>It also never made sense to me how Kuo would know about the precise dimensions of a single display that would be split into separate &#8220;display&#8221; and &#8220;function&#8221; areas. That&#8217;s something that would be handled by iOS in software, not something in the hardware. Kuo&#8217;s sources seem to be exclusively or almost exclusively in the Asian supply chain. I can&#8217;t recall him ever getting a major scoop related to software. My understanding is that Apple does not even send prerelease builds of iOS to China. Instead, Apple employees fly prototype iPhones from China back to the US for testing with development builds of iOS.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-08-05\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

As part of this, I deleted an account using an @daringfireball.net address that (I thought) I only used for viewing shared Google Docs, and added that same address as an alternate sign-in address for an existing Google account. Turns out, that was the account I&#8217;d used to create my YouTube account back in January. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any way to restore that deleted account because I had already reassigned the email address it used to another account. Oops.</p>\n\n<p>I just created a new channel and re-uploaded the same video. That&#8217;s what you see embedded above. If you subscribed before, please do again &#8212; this is the sort of mistake you only make once.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t really care about the lost views or subscribers. I don&#8217;t have plans to get deeply into YouTube, and if I do, I ought to reclaim those subscribers quickly. I hate breaking links though &#8212; I mean I <em>really</em> hate breaking links &#8212; and now I&#8217;ve inadvertently broken the link to my video for anyone who embedded it or tweeted it.

As part of this, I deleted an account using an @daringfireball.net address that (I thought) I only used for viewing shared Google Docs, and added that same address as an alternate sign-in address for an existing Google account. Turns out, that was the account I&#8217;d used to create my YouTube account back in January. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any way to restore that deleted account because I had already reassigned the email address it used to another account. Oops.</p>\n\n<p>I just created a new channel and re-uploaded the same video. That&#8217;s what you see embedded above. If you subscribed before, please do again &#8212; this is the sort of mistake you only make once.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t really care about the lost views or subscribers. I don&#8217;t have plans to get deeply into YouTube, and if I do, I ought to reclaim those subscribers quickly. I hate breaking links though &#8212; I mean I <em>really</em> hate breaking links &#8212; and now I&#8217;ve inadvertently broken the link to my video for anyone who embedded it or tweeted it.

Apple&#8217;s\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus were codenamed D10 and &#8212; confusingly &#8212; D20\nduring development, the report said.</p>\n\n<p>A three-model lineup jibes with rumors that Apple intends to\nlaunch two upgraded iPhone 7 models, likely branded &#8220;iPhone 7s&#8221;\nand &#8220;iPhone 7s Plus,&#8221; alongside a high-end version stuffed with\nexotic technology. This top-tier model, expected to boast a glass\nsandwich design, borderless OLED display, &#8220;invisible&#8221; home button,\nwireless charging and more, carries the internal codename\n&#8220;Ferrari,&#8221; according to today&#8217;s leaks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the first reference to D22 that I&#8217;ve been able to find, and thanks to Apple&#8217;s premature release of an iOS 11.0.2 image, we now know D22 is the code name for the upcoming new high-end iPhone I&#8217;ve been referring to as &#8220;iPhone Pro&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m nearly certain cnBeta was wrong about D20. Apple would <em>never</em> re-use a code name. It defeats the whole point of a code name. The iPhone 7 was D10 and iPhone 7 Plus was D11. You can find those code names in the shipping versions of iOS 10. </p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure D20 is the new 4.7-inch iPhone, and D21 the Plus-sized 5.5-inch model. The obvious product names for these devices would be 7S and 7S Plus, respectively. D10/D11 last year, D20/D21 this year &#8212; with D22 as the new cherry on top. That&#8217;s how Apple code names products.</p>\n\n<p>More interesting to me is the nickname &#8220;Ferrari&#8221;. Sounds like a good nickname for a sleek device <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/speculation_on_new_iphone_pricing\">that costs more</a>, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018iPhone D22&#8217;s Nickname May Have Been &#8216;Ferrari&#8217;\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/01/d22-ferrari\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"

        "summary": "<p>AppleInsider, back in December 2016:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Surfaced by a Sina Weibo user known for leaking information from\nApple&#8217;s East Asian supply chain, the supposed documentation\nsuggests Apple plans to market <a href=\"http://www.cnbeta.com/articles/569111.htm\">three iPhone models</a> designated\nD20, D21 and D22 in 2017, reports Chinese blog cnBeta. Apple&#8217;s\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus were codenamed D10 and &#8212; confusingly &#8212; D20\nduring development, the report said.</p>\n\n<p>A three-model lineup jibes with rumors that Apple intends to\nlaunch two upgraded iPhone 7 models, likely branded &#8220;iPhone 7s&#8221;\nand &#8220;iPhone 7s Plus,&#8221; alongside a high-end version stuffed with\nexotic technology. This top-tier model, expected to boast a glass\nsandwich design, borderless OLED display, &#8220;invisible&#8221; home button,\nwireless charging and more, carries the internal codename\n&#8220;Ferrari,&#8221; according to today&#8217;s leaks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the first reference to D22 that I&#8217;ve been able to find, and thanks to Apple&#8217;s premature release of an iOS 11.0.2 image, we now know D22 is the code name for the upcoming new high-end iPhone I&#8217;ve been referring to as &#8220;iPhone Pro&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m nearly certain cnBeta was wrong about D20. Apple would <em>never</em> re-use a code name. It defeats the whole point of a code name. The iPhone 7 was D10 and iPhone 7 Plus was D11. You can find those code names in the shipping versions of iOS 10. </p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure D20 is the new 4.7-inch iPhone, and D21 the Plus-sized 5.5-inch model. The obvious product names for these devices would be 7S and 7S Plus, respectively. D10/D11 last year, D20/D21 this year &#8212; with D22 as the new cherry on top. That&#8217;s how Apple code names products.</p>\n\n<p>More interesting to me is the nickname &#8220;Ferrari&#8221;. Sounds like a good nickname for a sleek device <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/speculation_on_new_iphone_pricing\">that costs more</a>, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018iPhone D22&#8217;s Nickname May Have Been &#8216;Ferrari&#8217;\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/01/d22-ferrari\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

Over the past couple of weeks, Stripe began handling\na large, though undisclosed, portion of Amazon\u2019s transactions.\nNeither company will address the scope of the deal &#8212; which was\nonly revealed by Stripe\u2019s addition of Amazon\u2019s logo to its website\n&#8212; but it could help Stripe greatly increase its transaction\nvolume. (Amazon had no comment.)</p>\n\n<p>Seven years in, however, Stripe\u2019s mission is less to send more\nbooks, vacuums, and grooming kits into the world than to \u201cincrease\nthe GDP of the internet,\u201d Patrick says. To do this, the company is\nbeginning to move beyond payments by writing software that helps\ncompanies retool the way they incorporate, pay workers, and detect\nfraud. It\u2019s part of an ambitious bid to revamp how online business\nhas been conducted for 20 years and to give anyone with a bright\nidea a chance to compete. \u201cWe think giving two people in a garage\nthe same infrastructure as a 100,000-person corporation &#8212; the\naggregate effects of that will be really good,\u201d Patrick says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The key to Stripe&#8217;s success was their laser-like focus on developers.

Over the past couple of weeks, Stripe began handling\na large, though undisclosed, portion of Amazon\u2019s transactions.\nNeither company will address the scope of the deal &#8212; which was\nonly revealed by Stripe\u2019s addition of Amazon\u2019s logo to its website\n&#8212; but it could help Stripe greatly increase its transaction\nvolume. (Amazon had no comment.)</p>\n\n<p>Seven years in, however, Stripe\u2019s mission is less to send more\nbooks, vacuums, and grooming kits into the world than to \u201cincrease\nthe GDP of the internet,\u201d Patrick says. To do this, the company is\nbeginning to move beyond payments by writing software that helps\ncompanies retool the way they incorporate, pay workers, and detect\nfraud. It\u2019s part of an ambitious bid to revamp how online business\nhas been conducted for 20 years and to give anyone with a bright\nidea a chance to compete. \u201cWe think giving two people in a garage\nthe same infrastructure as a 100,000-person corporation &#8212; the\naggregate effects of that will be really good,\u201d Patrick says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The key to Stripe&#8217;s success was their laser-like focus on developers. They made Stripe the easiest way to add payments to any system, and they have a great reputation for security and reliability.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Businessweek Profiles Stripe Co-Founders Patrick and John Collison\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/01/stripe\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

Our preliminary research indicates that all\nmajor VPN apps for iOS have been removed.</p>\n\n<p>Users in China accessing a different territory\u2019s App Store (i.e.\nthey have indicated their billing address to be outside of China)\nare not impacted; they can download the iOS app and continue to\nreceive updates as before. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Users in China can continue to stay connected to the open internet\nwith ExpressVPN\u2019s apps for Windows, Mac, Android, and other\nplatforms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html\">Paul Mozur&#8217;s report for The New York Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes\nprivacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its\nsoftware, too, had been taken down from the app store.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their\nbackdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are\nextremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China\nto remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation\nthat makes VPN illegal.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He added, \u201cWe view access to internet in China as a human rights\nissue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over\nprofits.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a popular sentiment &#8212; that Apple should have stood up to China&#8217;s demands and accepted the consequences, even if it meant losing sales in China. But it&#8217;s disingenuous to pretend that this situation is not fraught with complications.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also disingenuous to claim Apple has &#8220;bowed to pressure from China\nto remove VPN apps <em>without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal</em>&#8221;. The very next paragraph in the Times story says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced\nthis year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a\ngovernment license. \u201cWe have been required to remove some VPN apps\nin China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d the company said.\n\u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do\nbusiness.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2064587/chinas-move-clean-vpns-and-strengthen-great-firewall\">Here&#8217;s a story from The South China Morning Post in January about this crackdown</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Beijing has launched a 14-month nationwide campaign against\nunauthorised internet connections, including virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) services, which allow users to bypass the country\u2019s\ninfamous \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>A notice released by the Ministry of Industry and Information\nTechnology on Sunday said that all special cable and VPN services\non the mainland needed to obtain prior government approval &#8212; a\nmove making most VPN service providers illegal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a story from earlier this month <a href=\"http://technode.com/2017/07/19/vpns-continue-to-feel-the-pressure-as-a-beijing-luxury-hotel-halts-service/\">about the Waldorf Astoria in Beijing being forced to remove the VPN service that had previously been provided for guests</a>. New York Times reporter Paul Mozur (who lives in Beijing) posted to Twitter today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmozur/status/891963757508706304\">that Amazon is sending cease and desist letters to AWS customers using VPNs in China</a>. Apple is not alone.</p>\n\n<p>Too many people reacting to this story think that it&#8217;s about Apple deciding to acquiesce to this particular demand regarding VPN apps. It&#8217;s not. The real issues are two-fold:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should Apple be doing business in China at all?</li>\n<li>Should the App Store remain the only way to install apps on iOS devices?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Neither of these are simple topics, and I would (and am about to) argue that neither question has a clear-cut &#8220;this is the right thing to do&#8221; answer.</p>\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s dispose of the notion that Apple could have chosen to defy the Chinese government and keep the VPN apps in the App Store. Technically, Apple could have done that. But if they had, there would have been consequences. My guess is that the Chinese government would move to block all access to the App Store in China, or even block access to all Apple servers, period. This would effectively render all iOS devices mostly useless. iPhones have been <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/apples-china-problem/\">sagging in popularity in China for a few years now</a> &#8212; with no access to apps, their popularity would drop to zero. And Apple would have a lot of angry iPhone-owning users in China on its hands.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple tugged on the &#8220;<em>We refuse to remove these VPN apps from the App Store</em>&#8221; thread, it would inextricably lead to their leaving the entire Chinese market. It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;Apple shouldn&#8217;t have removed these apps.&#8221; It&#8217;s not so easy to say &#8220;Apple should pull out of China.&#8221; This is of course further complicated, politically, by the fact that the vast majority of Apple&#8217;s supply chain is in China.</p>\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> say it though. Yes, China is Apple&#8217;s second-biggest market in the world, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/03/apple-earnings-china-sales-tim-cook-enthusiastic.html\">accounting for almost $11 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended three months ago</a>. But Apple <em>could</em> take a stand and draw the line in the sand here.</p>\n\n<p>If you really think VPN apps in the App Store is the hill Apple should die on in China, I get it. But I do not agree.</p>\n\n<p>As I see it, there are only two scenarios:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A China where people can buy and use iPhones, but can&#8217;t get VPN apps from the App Store.</li>\n<li>A China where people can&#8217;t buy or use iPhones.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first scenario is obviously better for Apple financially. But I would argue that the first scenario is <em>also</em> better for the people of China.</p>\n\n<p>The thing I keep thinking about is that iMessage and FaceTime are among the few protocols available inside China with end-to-end encryption. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/technology/whatsapp-facebook-china-internet.html\">The Chinese just started blocking WhatsApp a few weeks ago</a>. I don&#8217;t know why they allow iMessage and FaceTime to continue working, but they do, and both of those protocols are designed from the ground up to <em>only</em> work using end-to-end encryption. There is no &#8220;off switch&#8221; for iMessage encryption that Apple can flip inside China. If you&#8217;re using iMessage, it&#8217;s encrypted. It would surprise no one if China started blocking iMessage and FaceTime, but for now, their availability is a real benefit to the people of China that seems to go largely unrecognized.</p>\n\n<p>To me, the more interesting question isn&#8217;t whether Apple should be selling its products in China, but rather whether Apple should continue to make the App Store the only way to install apps on iOS devices. A full-on &#8220;install whatever you want&#8221; policy isn&#8217;t going to happen, but something like <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491\">Gatekeeper</a> on MacOS could.</p>\n\n<p>Keep iOS App Store-only by default. Add a preference in Settings to allow apps to be downloaded from &#8220;identified developers&#8221; (those with an Apple developer certificate) in addition to the App Store. In that scenario, the App Store is no longer a single choke point for all native apps on the device.</p>\n\n<p>The App Store was envisioned as a means for Apple to maintain strict control over the software running on iOS devices. But in a totalitarian state like China (or perhaps Russia, next), it becomes a source of control for the totalitarian regime.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect Apple to do this. They&#8217;d rather deal with the negative consequences of the App Store as a choke point than give up the benefits (including the profits) of maintaining complete control over all software on the platform.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-07-31\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-07-31\">1</a></sup> But if you&#8217;re angry about Apple&#8217;s role in this VPN crackdown in China, I suggest you direct your anger at the App Store as the single source for third-party software.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-07-31\">\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that it&#8217;s not quite true that all software on iOS must come from the App Store. Anyone with a developer account can compile and install apps on their iOS devices from Xcode. There are a number of open source apps for iOS that are <a href=\"http://willhains.com/post/145882768224/introducing-kotoba\">distributed this way</a>. Open source VPN clients could be a workaround &#8212; albeit one with a high technical expertise barrier &#8212; for this VPN situation in China.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-07-31\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

It took exactly one decade for the iPhone to completely cannibalize Apple&#8217;s entire iPod business.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are still tens of millions of these iPods in use, and will be for years to come. They&#8217;re great for working out. The hardware form factor isn&#8217;t what did these in &#8212; it&#8217;s the antiquated notion of having to sync audio files to them via a cable connected to a Mac or PC. If the content on your audio player isn&#8217;t coming to it over the air, mostly likely streaming, it isn&#8217;t relevant.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to think about a Nano-sized iPod running iOS. In theory that&#8217;d be useful. But if it didn&#8217;t have cellular networking, it could only stream when you were on Wi-Fi. So people would just keep using what they&#8217;re using today for audio &#8212; their phones.

It took exactly one decade for the iPhone to completely cannibalize Apple&#8217;s entire iPod business.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are still tens of millions of these iPods in use, and will be for years to come. They&#8217;re great for working out. The hardware form factor isn&#8217;t what did these in &#8212; it&#8217;s the antiquated notion of having to sync audio files to them via a cable connected to a Mac or PC. If the content on your audio player isn&#8217;t coming to it over the air, mostly likely streaming, it isn&#8217;t relevant.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to think about a Nano-sized iPod running iOS. In theory that&#8217;d be useful. But if it didn&#8217;t have cellular networking, it could only stream when you were on Wi-Fi. So people would just keep using what they&#8217;re using today for audio &#8212; their phones. Even though the phone is a worse form factor purely as an audio player because it&#8217;s so big, comparatively, it&#8217;s better overall because it has a network connection almost everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>The iPod Touch (which Apple updated yesterday) exists as an alternative to an iPhone. An iPod Nano running iOS would exist as something people would buy, and then carry around, in addition to their iPhone.

                "value": "<p>In Markdown, you can create unordered lists using any of three characters as the &#8220;bullets&#8221;: asterisk (<code>*</code>), hyphen (<code>-</code>), or plus (<code>+</code>). Why all three? More or less: why not? Better to let people choose the character that feels most natural to them. I know a lot of Markdown users choose different characters for different levels of hierarchical lists, and that went into the original thinking as well.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been curious which list markers people actually use, so I did a poll on Twitter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/888494156443766784\">The results</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>42% Asterisk (<code>*</code>)</li>\n<li>54% Hyphen (<code>-</code>)</li>\n<li>04% Plus (<code>+</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can only respond to Twitter polls using Twitter&#8217;s official clients, and because a <em>lot</em> of my followers have the good taste to use third-party clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific, I wound up getting a lot of &#8220;responses&#8221; by way of replies to my tweet. They don&#8217;t show up in the results above, but eyeballing them, they&#8217;re right in line: lots of fans of asterisks and hyphens, crickets chirping for plus.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most surprised by how unpopular plus is. I use it a lot myself. The funny thing is, I&#8217;m not even sure how I&#8217;d answer the poll personally &#8212; I use all three, depending on my mood. Part of the reason Markdown supports all three characters is that I couldn&#8217;t decide on just one back in 2003, and I still can&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<p>The glaring omission in supported characters, of course, is an actual bullet (<code>\u2022</code>). If Markdown had only been something I&#8217;d meant to use myself, or among friends, I would have made use of punctuation characters outside the <a href=\"http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/comp/docs/ascii/\">7-bit ASCII range</a>, and literal bullets would have been first on the list. But at the time, character-encoding mismatches were still a daily problem. Today, UTF-8 is sufficiently universal that using such characters in an update to Markdown would probably work out fine.</p>"

                "value": "<p>The single biggest misconception about iOS is that it&#8217;s good digital hygiene to force quit apps that you aren&#8217;t using. The idea is that apps in the background are locking up unnecessary RAM and consuming unnecessary CPU cycles, thus hurting performance and wasting battery life.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not how iOS works. The iOS system is designed so that <em>none</em> of the above justifications for force quitting are true. Apps in the background are effectively &#8220;frozen&#8221;, severely limiting what they can do in the background and freeing up the RAM they were using. iOS is really, really good at this. It is so good at this that unfreezing a frozen app takes up <em>way</em> less CPU (and energy) than relaunching an app that had been force quit. Not only does force quitting your apps not help, it actually <em>hurts</em>. Your battery life will be worse and it will take much longer to switch apps if you force quit apps in the background.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/10/force-quitting-apps-doesnt-help-battery/\">Here&#8217;s a short and sweet answer from Craig Federighi</a>, in response to an email from a customer asking if he force quits apps and whether doing so preserves battery life: &#8220;No and no.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Here, from the official support document on forcing applications to close, is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\">Apple&#8217;s own advice on <em>when</em> to use this feature</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you double-click the Home button, your recently used apps\nappear. The apps aren\u2019t open, but they&#8217;re in standby mode to help\nyou navigate and multitask. You should force an app to close only\nwhen it\u2019s unresponsive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> MacDailyNews quotes a 2010 email from Steve Jobs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just use [iOS multitasking] as designed, and you\u2019ll be happy. No\nneed to ever quit apps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just in case you don&#8217;t believe Apple&#8217;s senior vice president for software, Apple&#8217;s own official support documentation, or Steve Jobs, here are some other articles pointing out how this habit is actually detrimental to iPhone battery life:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fraser Speirs (back in 2012!): &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.speirs.org/blog/2012/1/2/misconceptions-about-ios-multitasking.html\">Misconceptions About iOS Multitasking</a>&#8221;</li>\n<li>Thorin Klosowski: &#8220;<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/quitting-apps-in-ios-actually-worsens-battery-life-1560086834\">Quitting All Your Apps in iOS Can Actually Worsen Battery Life</a>&#8221;</li>\n<li>Kendall Baker: &#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@kendallbaker/stop-force-quitting-your-iphone-apps-eb13d86caaa5\">Stop Force Quitting Your iPhone Apps</a>&#8221;</li>\n<li>The Wirecutter: &#8220;<a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/blog/what-you-should-and-shouldnt-do-to-extend-your-phones-battery-life/#myth-close-quit-unused-apps\">What You Should (and Shouldn&#8217;t) Do to Extend Your Phone&#8217;s Battery Life</a>&#8221;</li>\n<li>Kyle Richter: &#8220;<a href=\"http://martiancraft.com/blog/2016/02/force-quit-2/\">The Force Quit Fallacy</a>&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This thing about force quitting apps in the background is such a pernicious myth that I&#8217;ve heard numerous stories from DF readers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schwa/status/152425874581491712\">about Apple Store Genius Bar staff recommending it to customers</a>. Those &#8220;geniuses&#8221; are anything but geniuses.</p>\n\n<p>It occurs to me that some of the best examples <em>proving</em> that this notion is wrong (at least in terms of performance) are YouTube &#8220;speed test&#8221; benchmarks. There&#8217;s an entire genre of YouTube videos devoted to benchmarking new phones by running them through a series of apps and CPU-intensive tasks repeatedly, going through the loop twice. Once from a cold boot and the second time immediately after the first loop. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn-2B82B1mg\">Here&#8217;s a perfect example, pitting a Samsung Galaxy S8 against an iPhone 7 Plus</a>. Note that no apps are manually force quit on either device. The iPhone easily wins on the first loop, but where the iPhone really shines is on the second loop. The S8 has to relaunch all (or at least almost all) of the apps, because Android has forced them to quit while in the background to reclaim the RAM they were using. On the iPhone, all (or nearly all) of the apps re-animate almost instantly.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, apps frozen in the background on iOS unfreeze so quickly that I think it actually helps perpetuate the myth that you should force quit them: if you&#8217;re worried that background apps are draining your battery and you see how quickly they load from the background, it&#8217;s a reasonable assumption to believe that they never stopped running. But they did. They really do get frozen, the RAM they were using really does get reclaimed by the system, and they really do unfreeze and come back to life that quickly.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-07-19\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-07-19\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>An awful lot of very hard work went into making iOS work like this. It&#8217;s a huge technical advantage that iOS holds over Android. And every iPhone user in the world who habitually force quits background apps manually is wasting all of the effort that went into this while simultaneously wasting their own device&#8217;s battery life and making everything slower for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This pernicious myth is longstanding and seemingly will not die. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2012/01/ios_multitasking\">I wrote about it at length back in 2012</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like with any voodoo, there are die-hard believers. I\u2019m quite\ncertain that I am going to receive email from people who will\nswear up-and-down that emptying this list of used applications\nevery hour or so keeps their iPhone running better than it would\notherwise. Nonsense.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.speirs.org/blog/2012/1/2/misconceptions-about-ios-multitasking.html\">As Fraser mentions</a>, yes, there are exceptional situations where an\napp with background privileges can get stuck, and you need to kill\nthat app. The argument here is not that you should never have to\nkill any app using the multitasking switcher &#8212; the argument is\nthat you don\u2019t need to do it on a regular basis, and you\u2019re not\nmaking anything \u201cbetter\u201d by clearing the list. Shame on the\n\u201cgeniuses\u201d who are peddling this advice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started on people who completely power down their iPhones while putting them back into their pockets or purses.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-07-19\">\n<p>The other contributing factor to believing that force quitting is good for your iPhone are the handful of apps that have been found to be repeated abusers of loopholes in iOS, such that they really do continue running in the background, wasting battery life. Most infamously, Facebook was caught playing silent audio tracks in the background to take advantage of APIs that allow audio-playing apps to play audio from the background. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/facebook-says-it-fixed-a-bug-that-caused-silent-audio-to-vampire-your-iphone-battery/\">They called it a &#8220;bug&#8221;</a>. In those cases force-quitting the apps really did help, and I see no reason to trust Facebook. So if you want to keep force quitting Facebook, go right ahead. But don&#8217;t let one bad app spoil the whole barrel. The Battery section in the iOS Settings app can show you which apps are actually consuming energy in the background &#8212; tap the clock icon under &#8220;Battery Usage&#8221; and don&#8217;t force quit any app that isn&#8217;t a genuine culprit.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-07-19\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

In other\nwords, by bringing tomorrow&#8217;s iPhone to market today.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the business, it&#8217;s really no different than getting an\niPhone onto Verizon, onto China Mobile, with bigger and bigger\ndisplays, or with smaller displays again &#8212; it&#8217;s about annexing\nadjacent markets and maximizing the revenue potential for iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>As it becomes harder to sell more iPhones &#8212; the population of\nearth is now a limiting factor &#8212; selling <em>more of an iPhone</em>\nbecomes beneficial. It&#8217;s the same benefit Apple gets from selling\nservices revenue on top of iPhone, but in atoms, not bits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ritchie is using the name &#8220;iPhone 8&#8221; to refer to what I&#8217;ve called the &#8220;iPhone Pro&#8221; &#8212; the high-end OLED-display model that I think might start at over $1000. Name aside, I think he&#8217;s got exactly the right idea on how Apple can position this: <em>a future iPhone today</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Honda used to sell a car in the U.S. called the Prelude. <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/honda/prelude/history/\">Edmunds&#8217;s description</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Honda established itself in America with the Civic and Accord &#8212;\nboth good, solid but basic cars. But big profits in the automotive\nworld don&#8217;t come from basic cars that sell for commodity prices.\nThose profits come from cars that get consumers so excited that\nthey&#8217;ll pay a premium price just to have one. The Prelude was\nHonda&#8217;s first attempt at an exciting car.</p>\n\n<p>The Prelude was Honda&#8217;s technological leading edge. Features that\nare now expected from Honda, like the double-wishbone suspension\nunder the Accord, fuel injection, and VTEC electronic variable\nvalve timing system showed up first on the Prelude before\nmigrating across the Honda line (though VTEC first showed up on\nthe 1990 Acura NSX). The Prelude was also a test bed for some\ntechnologies that went nowhere, like four-wheel steering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a broad sense, that&#8217;s my idea for the iPhone Pro &#8212; a premium-priced product that offers us early access to technologies and components that will be (or even just might be) in all iPhones in another year or two.</p>"

[&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>One of those is wireless charging. The iPhone 8 &#8212; let\u2019s call it\nthat for now &#8212; will reportedly use a type of inductive charging,\nwhere the phone sits directly on a separate charging device. (Our\nsource believes Apple is using the Qi wireless charging standard,\nor a variant of it.) The wireless charging components, which are\nprovided by chipmaker Broadcom Ltd., are not the key issue, the\nsource said; it\u2019s the software that\u2019s not ready for prime time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That sort of matches up with what I heard \u2014 that inductive charging might miss the September debut because the software isn\u2019t ready. I have not heard anything about any sort of \u201cpanic\u201d. Summers are crunch time for iOS engineers, and the deadline for iOS 11.0 is probably no more than a month away at this point. But if inductive charging has to wait until 11.1 in October or November, it\u2019ll be a disappointment, but not much more so than having to wait for the iPhone 7 Plus\u2019s Portrait Mode to come out of beta last fall.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3207529/mobile-wireless/apple-hits-iphone-8-panic-mode-get-real.html\">Jonny Evans, writing for Computerworld yesterday</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It\u2019s the same thing every year these days. It\u2019s incredibly\npredictable.</p>\n\n<p>It goes like this: Having reported every claimed product feature\npeople then switch to criticizing all those features, and &#8212; when\nthe shelf life on &#8220;anti-reports&#8221; of this kind time out, the\nself-same sources swiftly shift to shuffling speculation saying\nsuch-and-such features will apparently be &#8220;delayed&#8221;. Seriously!</p>\n\n<p>All of this drama and Apple hasn\u2019t even announced anything yet.</p>\n\n<p>How can something that hasn\u2019t been announced ever be delayed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cApple engineers are panicking\u201d is an exciting story. \u201cApple engineers are in crunch mode to finish iOS 11.0 just like they are every summer\u201d is not.</p>\n\n<p>It could be that things are in worse shape than usual, and there truly is a panic to get iOS 11&#8217;s support for new iPhone hardware finished on schedule. But everything I&#8217;ve heard suggests it&#8217;s the same as usual at this point in the summer: busy down to the wire, yes; frantic panic, no.</p>\n\n<p>Today Sullivan has another report, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40440342/apple-is-working-hard-on-an-iphone-8-rear-facing-3d-laser-for-ar-and-autofocus-source\">claiming Apple is trying to integrate laser sensors into the rear of the high-end new iPhone</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A source with knowledge of the situation tells Fast Company Apple\nis working hard to add a rear-facing 3D laser system to the back\nof one of the new iPhones to be announced this fall. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>The source said the VSCEL laser system is probably intended for\nthe 10th anniversary iPhone (which may be called the iPhone 8 or\nthe iPhone Pro or, hopefully, the iPhone X). Whether the sensor\nwill be included in that phone, or a 2018 iPhone, depends on the\nprogress the Apple engineers make in integrating the laser system\ninto the phone, our source says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds cool &#8212; and also sounds like the sort of feature that could justify <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/speculation_on_new_iphone_pricing\">a significantly higher price for an iPhone Pro</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But I think it&#8217;s bonkers to think that Apple is still working on hardware decisions like this in the middle of July. Apple is super-secretive about this stuff, but from what I&#8217;ve gathered over the years, by this state in the game the hardware design has long been decided. They&#8217;re in the late stages of <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-EVT-DVT-and-PVT-in-engineering-validation-tests\">validation testing</a>, not designing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gak_pdx/status/884950941849370624\">Greg Koenig on Twitter two days ago</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For a volume Sep. launch, production tooling is being ground right\nnow. It\u2019s been pencils down for a while.</p>\n\n<p>If not? Huge shit show.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With software Apple can (and does) play a bit fast and loose. iOS 11.0 won&#8217;t be baked until late August. But software can (and always is) patched. Hardware doesn&#8217;t work like that. Many of the decisions related to the hardware on this year&#8217;s new iPhones were made two years ago. (And there are decisions being made now for 2019&#8217;s new iPhones.)</p>\n\n<p>Is there a 3D laser sensor on the back of the new iPhone? Is there a Touch ID sensor?<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-07-13\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-07-13\">1</a></sup> I don&#8217;t know. But Apple knows, and has known for a while. Months, even.</p>\n\n<p>If the hardware were still up in the air today, it&#8217;d be an impossible target for the software, never mind for Apple&#8217;s incredibly high-scale production ramp. I believe Apple is months ahead of these rumors &#8212; what we hear now with reports like this are just echoes of decisions that have already been made.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-07-13\">\n<p>Might as well address this rumor here. A ton of readers have expressed deep skepticism regarding reports that the OLED iPhone doesn&#8217;t have a Touch ID sensor. &#8220;<em>That&#8217;s impossible, Apple Pay relies on Touch ID</em>&#8221; is the basic sentiment. I think it&#8217;s possible that there&#8217;s no Touch ID sensor on the OLED iPhone, but if that&#8217;s the case, then the new 3D face scanner has to be as good or better than Touch ID in every regard. It has to be just as fast, just as accurate, and just as trustworthy. It also would have to work from a wide range of angles. <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dreaming-persistent-ambient-authentication-iphone-11\">As Rene Ritchie has sagely written</a>, the end game is &#8220;persistent, ambient authentication&#8221; &#8212; fingerprints are not particularly magic.</p>\n\n<p>But, if the new iPhone ships without a Touch ID sensor <em>and</em> there is no replacement authentication technology that is as good or better than Touch ID &#8212; that would be a dead canary in the coal mine.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-07-13\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"
